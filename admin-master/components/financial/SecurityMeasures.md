# Stripe Payment Integration Security Measures

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Plus Vans Stripe payment integration to ensure secure payment processing and protect user data.

## 1. Webhook Security

### Signature Verification
- **Webhook Endpoint Protection**: All Stripe webhooks are validated using cryptographic signatures
- **Secret Key Verification**: Environment variable `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` used for signature validation
- **Tamper Detection**: Any modification to webhook payloads will be detected and rejected

```typescript
const validateWebhookSignature = (buf: Buffer, sig: string, secret: string): Stripe.Event => {
  try {
    return stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(buf, sig, secret);
  } catch (err: any) {
    console.error(`Webhook signature verification failed: ${err.message}`);
    throw new Error(`Webhook signature verification failed: ${err.message}`);
  }
};
```

### Event Processing Security
- **Metadata Validation**: All payment intents include validated metadata (invoice_id, booking_id)
- **Database Integrity**: Atomic operations for status updates
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging without exposing sensitive data

## 2. Environment Variables Security

### Required Secure Environment Variables
```bash
# Production Values Only
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...

# Database Security
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
```

### Environment Variable Validation
- **Configuration Checker**: `checkStripeConfig()` validates all required variables at startup
- **Missing Variable Detection**: Application fails gracefully if required variables are missing
- **Development/Production Separation**: Different keys for different environments

## 3. Payment Data Security

### PCI Compliance
- **No Card Data Storage**: Card details are handled entirely by Stripe
- **Tokenization**: All sensitive payment data is tokenized by Stripe
- **Secure Transmission**: All communication uses HTTPS/TLS encryption

### Data Validation
- **Amount Validation**: All payment amounts are validated and sanitized
- **Currency Validation**: Currency codes are validated against supported formats
- **Invoice Verification**: Invoice existence is verified before payment processing

```typescript
// Amount sanitization (convert to cents)
const amount = Math.round(parseFloat(formData.amount) * 100);

// Invoice validation
const booking = supabase.table("bookings").select("*").eq("id", payment.booking_id).execute();
if (!booking.data) {
  throw HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Booking not found");
}
```

## 4. API Security

### Request Validation
- **Method Restrictions**: Only POST requests allowed for payment endpoints
- **Content-Type Validation**: JSON content type required
- **Body Size Limits**: Request body size limits to prevent DoS attacks

### Rate Limiting
- **Payment Attempt Limits**: Multiple failed payment attempts are tracked and limited
- **IP-based Rate Limiting**: Prevent brute force attacks on payment endpoints
- **Session-based Limits**: Prevent abuse of payment creation endpoints

### Error Handling
- **Sanitized Error Messages**: No sensitive information in error responses
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive server-side logging for debugging
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear, non-technical error messages for users

## 5. Frontend Security

### Stripe Elements Integration
- **Secure Card Input**: Uses Stripe Elements for PCI-compliant card data collection
- **CSP Headers**: Content Security Policy headers configured for Stripe domains
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All payment pages served over HTTPS

### Payment Method Security
- **Method Validation**: Payment method selection is validated on both client and server
- **Amount Display**: Payment amounts are clearly displayed and confirmed
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling for payment flows

## 6. Database Security

### Payment Record Protection
- **Encrypted Storage**: Sensitive payment data encrypted at rest in Supabase
- **Access Control**: Row-level security (RLS) policies in place
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit trail of all payment status changes

### Data Integrity
- **Transaction Consistency**: Database transactions ensure data consistency
- **Backup Security**: Regular encrypted backups of payment data
- **Retention Policies**: Payment data retention according to legal requirements

## 7. Monitoring & Alerting

### Payment Monitoring
- **Failed Payment Alerts**: Automatic alerts for payment failures
- **Webhook Monitoring**: Webhook delivery and processing monitoring
- **Performance Monitoring**: Payment processing time monitoring

### Security Monitoring
- **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Monitoring for unusual payment patterns
- **Failed Authentication Alerts**: Alerts for webhook signature failures
- **Rate Limit Monitoring**: Tracking rate limit violations

## 8. Compliance & Standards

### Industry Standards
- **PCI DSS Compliance**: Leveraging Stripe's PCI compliance for card processing
- **GDPR Compliance**: Data processing in accordance with GDPR requirements
- **SOX Compliance**: Financial transaction audit trails for compliance

### Data Protection
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all data transmission
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for stored payment data
- **Key Management**: Secure key rotation policies

## 9. Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedures
- **Immediate Response**: Automated alerts for security incidents
- **Escalation Process**: Clear escalation path for payment security issues
- **Recovery Procedures**: Documented recovery procedures for payment system failures

### Breach Prevention
- **Access Logging**: Complete audit logs of all payment system access
- **Privilege Management**: Least privilege access to payment systems
- **Regular Security Reviews**: Quarterly security assessments

## 10. Testing & Validation

### Security Testing
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular penetration testing of payment endpoints
- **Webhook Testing**: Validation of webhook security measures
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end security testing of payment flows

### Validation Procedures
- **Payment Flow Validation**: Complete testing of all payment scenarios
- **Error Handling Validation**: Testing of all error conditions
- **Security Control Validation**: Regular validation of security controls

## Security Contact

For security-related issues or concerns regarding the payment integration, please contact the security team immediately through the established incident response channels.

**Remember**: Never store card details locally, always use Stripe's secure tokenization, and regularly review security measures as the system evolves.
